##üå§Ô∏è Project Title: Weather Forecast Web App Using Public API
üìù Project Description:
This project is a responsive web application that fetches and displays real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It was developed as part of Task 1 for the Full Stack Development Internship at CodTech. The main objective was to integrate a public API into a self-built webpage and dynamically show the data to users. As a beginner in web development, this project gave me hands-on experience with core web technologies ‚Äî HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî and taught me how web apps interact with external data sources using APIs.

The app allows the user to input the name of any city. Upon clicking the ‚ÄúGet Weather‚Äù button, it sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieves the current weather data for the specified city, and displays it on the page. The displayed information includes the city name, temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed ‚Äî all fetched live from the internet. This makes the app highly interactive and practical, as it displays real-time data based on user input.

The entire user interface (UI) was built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The styling is kept simple yet clean ‚Äî making the app usable and readable on both desktop and mobile screens. To ensure dynamic behavior, JavaScript was used to handle events, fetch data from the API, and inject the response into the HTML page without reloading it. The JavaScript code uses fetch() and async/await, which are modern, clean approaches for handling asynchronous data operations.

I used macOS built-in tools (like TextEdit in plain text mode) to write the code and Safari browser for testing, without needing external editors like VS Code. This also helped me understand the importance of saving files correctly with proper extensions and syntax, especially when handling plain code files. One of the key learnings was understanding that even small issues ‚Äî like an extra space in an HTML attribute or saving a file in .rtf instead of .html ‚Äî can break the entire functionality. Fixing these through trial, error, and debugging helped sharpen my problem-solving skills.

Integrating the OpenWeatherMap API required signing up, verifying my email, retrieving a personal API key, and securely inserting it into the JavaScript file. This process helped me learn about API authentication and the role of API keys in limiting and securing access. I also learned to construct API URLs using string templates and query parameters to fetch the correct data for a user-specified city.

The final result is a functional and neat weather application that:

Takes user input

Fetches real-time weather data

Displays that data clearly and instantly

This project taught me more than just syntax. I learned how the web works, how a browser and JavaScript communicate with external servers (APIs), and how to design a basic but real-world useful application from scratch. It also gave me confidence to build future projects using APIs ‚Äî such as news apps, COVID trackers, or anything that requires real-time data.

In conclusion, Task 1 was a foundational experience in becoming a full-stack developer. It gave me an excellent understanding of the basics of frontend development and API integration, preparing me for more complex tasks in the upcoming internship challenges.
